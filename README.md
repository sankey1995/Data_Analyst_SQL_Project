"HR Data Analysis: Leveraging SQL to Uncover Key Insights and Performance Metrics"

This project involves a data analyst project using SQL. 
The project includes the following steps:
1. Created a database named "hr_analyst".
2. Added two tables from an Excel file that was first converted to a CSV file and then added to the database.
3. Cross-checked the data to ensure that it was correctly added using the SELECT * FROM command.
4. Solved several KPIs related to work balance, attrition rate, working years, and monthly income statistics. This was achieved using queries that created temporary columns using the CASE statement, subqueries, and various functions such as AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, FORMAT, CONCAT, etc.
5. The data was grouped by specific criteria using the GROUP BY clause, and various joins were used to retrieve insights from the data.
This project aims to showcase the data analyst's proficiency in SQL and their ability to manipulate and analyze data to gain valuable insights into HR data. The project includes the SQL queries used to achieve the above steps and any visualizations or additional insights gained from the data. The project is intended to be an example of how SQL can be used for HR data analysis and a resource for anyone interested in this field.
