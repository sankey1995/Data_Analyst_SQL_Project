"HR Data Analysis: Leveraging SQL to Uncover Key Insights and Performance Metrics"
The data analyst project involves creating a database named "hr_analyst" and adding two tables to it from an Excel file that has been converted to a CSV file. The data will be cross-checked using the SELECT * FROM command to ensure that it has been added correctly.

Once the data has been added to the database, several key performance indicators (KPIs) will be created. This will involve creating temporary columns using the CASE statement, subqueries, and various functions such as AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, FORMAT, CONCAT, etc.

The data will then be grouped by certain criteria using the GROUP BY clause, and various joins will be used to retrieve insights from the data. The ultimate goal of the project is to gain valuable insights into the HR data and identify areas where improvements can be made.
